## üöÄ Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed for learners beginning their journey in **Data Science** and **Applied Statistics**. Through a mix of **Markdown explanations, interactive code, and visualization**, you will learn how to:

- Understand and calculate **Z-scores** and **T-scores**  
- Use **standardization** to transform datasets  
- Apply the **Shapiro-Wilk test** for testing **normality**  
- Connect **p-values** with hypothesis testing decisions  
- Normalize and standardize real-world datasets using **Min-Max scaling** and **z-score standardization**  
- Visualize statistical concepts with **histograms, density plots, and box plots**  
- Explore APIs and perform normality checks on **live datasets** from the web  
- Build coding confidence with both **scaffolded exercises** and **open-ended challenges**
